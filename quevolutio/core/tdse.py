    Interface for representing a Hamiltonian. This class can be extended to
    contain system specific attributes, pre-computed operators and methods as
    required.

    Attributes
    ----------
    domain : QuantumHilbertSpace
        The discretised Hilbert space (domain) of the quantum system.
    eigenvalue_min : float
        The minimum eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian.
    eigenvalue_max : float
        The maximum eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian.
    time_dependent : bool
        A boolean flag that indicates whether the Hamiltonian has explicit time
        dependence.
    ke_time_dependent : bool
        A boolean flag that indicates whether the KE operator has explicit time
        dependence.
    pe_time_dependent : bool
        A boolean flag that indicates whether the PE operator has explicit time
        dependence.
